This repository contains the code to capture image frames from either video ('.mp4', '.stream', .etc.) or image frame sources ('.jpg', '.png').

Please note that numerous adjustments have been made to make the code easy to run outside of the AWS cloud environment that it was originally written for. Anywhere where the 'LOCAL' variable is used throughout the `task.py` script is intended to make it easier; however, all of these `LOCAL` alternatives would be removed in a fully operational data pipeline.
